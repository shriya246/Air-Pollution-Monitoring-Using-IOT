# Air-Pollution-Monitoring-Using-IOT
## ðŸš€ How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/air-pollution-monitoring.git
cd air-pollution-monitoring
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Setup AWS IoT Certificates
Ensure you have the following certificate files from AWS IoT:
Amazon-root-CA-1.pem
device.cert.pem
private.pem.key
Place them in the same directory as air_monitoring.py.

### 4. Run the Monitoring Script
```bash
python air_monitoring.py
```

You can control the sensor monitoring by publishing the following MQTT commands to the gasmonitor/data topic:
"start reading" to begin monitoring
"stop reading" to halt it
